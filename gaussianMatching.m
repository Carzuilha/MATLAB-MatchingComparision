%                            GAUSSIAN MATCHING
% 
%   This script is reponsible for the gausian matching process between 
% corners. It's the almost the same process from the single matching 
% process; but now, a Gaussian noise is added to the images before matching.
% The obtained results are also stored in a .csv file.
